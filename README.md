# embeddings

# Structure of the repo
### Final embeddings are in the /baseline_embeddings directory
### The alternative model embeddings have not been included due to git file limit but they can regenerated by running the three ipython notebooks and varying the parameters in the notebook.
### To generate the evaluation scores, run the Evaluation.ipynb file in the /eval folder. This file requires two files "MRSTY.RFF" and "MRCONSO.RFF" to run properly. These files have not been included in the repo due to license agreements from UMLS prohibiting the files from being places in public domains. If needed, we show you how the files are generated in a private session.
